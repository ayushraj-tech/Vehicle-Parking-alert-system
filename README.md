# Vehicle-Parking-alert-system
Code Senpai

Reverse parking is difficult because drivers cannot accurately judge the distance behind the vehicle.
In narrow or crowded parking areas, this often leads to scratches, minor accidents, or damage to the vehicle.
Relying only on visual judgement is unsafe, especially for new drivers and in low-visibility conditions.
Therefore, there is a need for a simple alert system that warns the driver when the vehicle gets too close to an obstacle.
